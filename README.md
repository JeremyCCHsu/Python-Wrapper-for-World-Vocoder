Morise's World Vocoder is a fast and high-quality vocoder.
World Vocoder parameterizes speech into three components:

  1. Pitch (fundamental frequency, F0) contour  
  2. Harmonic spectral envelope
  3. Aperiodic spectral envelope (relative to the harmonic spectral envelope)

It can also resynthesize speech using these features (see examples below).

For more information, please visit [Morise's World repository](https://github.com/mmorise/World)
and the [official website of World Vocoder](http://ml.cs.yamanashi.ac.jp/world/english/)


## I. APIs

### Vocoder Functions
```python
import pyworld as pw
_f0, t = pw.dio(x, fs)    # raw pitch extractor
f0 = pw.stonemask(x, _f0, t, fs)  # pitch refinement
sp = pw.cheaptrick(x, f0, t, fs)  # extract smoothed spectrogram
ap = pw.d4c(x, f0, t, fs)         # extract aperiodicity
y = pw.synthesize(f0, sp, ap, fs)
```


### Utility
```python
# Convert speech into features (using default options)
f0, sp, ap = pw.wav2world(x, fs)
```
<br/>


## II. Installation

### Pip installation
`pip install pyworld`  
<br/>

### Installing from Github
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeremyCCHsu/Python-Wrapper-for-World-Vocoder.git
cd Python-Wrapper-for-World-Vocoder
git submodule update --init
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```
It will automatically `git clone` Morise's World Vocoder (C++ version).<br/>
(It seems to me that using `virtualenv` or `conda` is the best practice.)<br/>
<br/>
You can validate installation by running
```bash
cd demo
python demo.py
```
to see if you get results in `test/` direcotry.
(Please avoid writing and executing codes in the `Python-Wrapper-for-World-Vocoder` folder for now.)<br/>

### Other Installation Suggestions
1. Use `pip install .` is safer and you can easily uninstall pyworld by `pip uninstall pyworld`
2. Another way to install pyworld is via<br/>
   `python setup.py install`<br/>
   - Add `--user` if you don't have root access<br/>
   - Add `--record install.txt` to track the installation dir<br/>
3. If you just want to try out some experiments, execute<br/>
  `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`<br/>
  Then you can use PyWorld from this directory.<br/>
  You can also copy the resulting **pyworld.so** (pyworld.{arch}.pyd on Windows) file to
  `~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages` (or corresponding Windows directory)
  so that you can use it everywhere like an installed package.<br/>
  Alternatively you can copy/symlink the compiled files using pip, e.g. `pip install -e .`

### Environment/Dependencies  
- Operating systems
  - Linux Ubuntu 16.04/14.04
  - Windows (thanks to [wuaalb](https://github.com/wuaalb))
- Python
  - 2.7 (Windows is currently not supported)
  - 3.7/3.6/3.5
  - Required packages
    - Cython 0.24 (or later versions; required)
    - Numpy
  - Optional (for demo.py only)
    - argparse
    - pysoundfile
    - Matplotlib

You can simply install these by `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Troubleshooting
1. Upgrade your Cython version to 0.24.<br/>
   (I failed to build it on Cython 0.20.1post0)<br/>
   It'll require you to download Cython form http://cython.org/<br/>
   Unzip it, and `python setup.py install` it.<br/>
   (I tried `pip install Cython` but the upgrade didn't seem correct)<br/>
   (Again, add `--user` if you don't have root access.)
2. Upon executing `demo/demo.py`, the following code might be needed in some environments (e.g. when you're working on a remote Linux server):<br/>

 ```python
 import matplotlib
 matplotlib.use('Agg')
 ```
3. If you encounter `library not found: sndfile` error upon executing `demo.py`,  
   you might have to install it by `apt-get install libsoundfile1`.  
   You can also replace `pysoundfile` with `scipy` or `librosa`, but some modification is needed:   
   - librosa:
     - load(fiilename, dtype=np.float64)
     - output.write_wav(filename, wav, fs)
     - remember to pass `dtype` argument to ensure that the method gives you a `double`.
   - scipy:
     - You'll have to write a customized utility function based on the following methods
     - scipy.io.wavfile.read (but this gives you `short`)
     - scipy.io.wavfile.write
